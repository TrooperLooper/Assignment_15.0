                Moxes are a unique gang in the annals of Night City, as they
                were formed not with the intention of taking over any territory
                or getting rich selling drugs, they formed simply with the goal
                of keeping each other safe. Based out of Lizzieâ€™s bar in the
                Kabuki sub-district of Watson - The Moxes are made up of a whole
                cross-section of outcasts, including both male and female
                sex-workers. Though the group does not necessarily seek out
                violence for its own sake, the gang is currently in an ongoing
                battle with the Tyger Claws, a gang that controls much of the
                lucrative sex trade in the area. Though the name Suzy is
                mentioned in the retailer, very little is known about the
                leadership of the Moxes. What is known, however, is that the
                Moxes don't prescribe to the customary hierarchy many of the
                other gangs of Night City do. They see themselves as more of a
                collective than a gang, though they do take part in a number of
                nefarious activities as a means of bringing in income. It
                appears, at least from the available information, that the Moxes
                were created for Cyberpunk 2077 specifically.
