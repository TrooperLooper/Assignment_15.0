              Moxes are a unique gang in the annals of Night City, as they were
              formed not with the intention of taking over any territory or
              getting rich selling drugs, they formed simply with the goal of
              keeping each other safe. Based out of Lizzie’s bar in the Kabuki
              sub-district of Watson - The Moxes are made up of a whole
              cross-section of outcasts, including both male and female
              sex-workers. Though the group does not necessarily seek out
              violence for its own sake, the gang is currently in an ongoing
              battle with the Tyger Claws, a gang that controls much of the
              lucrative sex trade in the area. Though the name Suzy is mentioned
              in the retailer, very little is known about the leadership of the
              Moxes. What is known, however, is that the Moxes don’t prescribe
              to the customary hierarchy many of the other gangs of Night City
              do. They see themselves as more of a collective than a gang,
              though they do take part in a number of nefarious activities as a
              means of bringing in income. It appears, at least from the
              available information, that the Moxes were created for Cyberpunk
              2077 specifically.
